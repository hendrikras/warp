 * threads.h — minimal fork-join pool for row-parallel kernels.
 *
 * No OpenMP: Apple's clang does not ship it, and a build dependency for
 * one parallel-for is not worth it. Workers are created once and parked on
 * a condvar; waste_parallel_for splits [0,n) across them and blocks until
 * all have finished. Splitting is by row, so results are bit-identical to
 * the serial version regardless of thread count.
 *
 * Windows needs nothing here: MinGW implements pthreads over winpthreads,
 * so the pool below compiles and runs unchanged. Only the CPU count was
 * POSIX-only, and that now comes from platform.h.
 *
 * Placement is the OS's unless a caller names a cpuset. It is worth naming
 * on a machine whose cores are not interchangeable: on a two-CCD Ryzen,
 * six threads on one CCD measured 16-25% faster than the same six split
 * across both, at identical bytes read (issue #23), because the split pair
 * reaches the other die's L3 over Infinity Fabric and the barrier waits
 * for whoever is slowest. LEARNED §47 is the same shape with P-cores and
 * E-cores instead of dies. Neither is a default — §47 measured "cap the
 * pool" as a 25% win on one model and a 34% loss on another — so this is
 * a switch, and the engine still chooses nothing on its own.
